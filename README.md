# jobsearch
Software to manage all of the connections and conversations in your job search

# Getting Started
The UI is a node application.  Here's an easy way to get going:
1. Install homebrew - https://brew.sh/
   - export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
2. Install node and nps - *brew install node*
3. Install typescript
   - npm install -g typescript
4. You will need to run the API service if the application is going to be functional: https://github.com/joddyjods/jobsearch-api
4. Set up the material UI support - https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/

# Running the application
- **npm** start - note that it will run on port 3000 by default
- **npm** test - runs the test runner
- **npm** start - starts the development server

# Things that are next to do
- [ ] Make the UI do something with the API service
- [ ] Take a look at incorporating material UI - https://mui.com
